# ChatGPT_Voice

The ChatGPT_Voice project is primarily intended to make the user's interaction with ChatGPT a natural conversation and also to serve users who have difficulty typing
on the keyboard or who have some visual impairment. The code uses the ChatGPT API to obtain the answers generated by the microphone and then the information is 
sent and transformed by the Google Voice library (gTTS) into audio for the user.

# Instructions

Install the necessary libraries for the program to work, the instructions will be below with their respective commands and installation sites.
Get a ChatGPT API key, available on the OpenAI website: https://openai.com/api/
Create an account to get access.
After logging in, click on "Personal" at the top right of the site.
Access the "View API Keys" tab
Click on "Create a new secret key" to generate an access key.
Copy the key that appears and inside the script, on line 31, expand the "post_gpt" function and paste the code for the key in "api_key".
Run the script and wait for the message "Say something" to appear in the terminal. When it does, speak something into the microphone and the response
will be played back in audio. The process will continue to run until the program receives nothing from the microphone, then it will automatically end.
